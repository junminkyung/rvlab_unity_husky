# RVLab-HUSKY(2023.09 ~ 2024.04)
- Reinforcement Learning for Husky Robot using Unity ML-Agents
- This project explores reinforcement learning on a Husky robot using Unity ML-Agents. 
- Through extensive trial and error, we designed and refined reward functions to optimize learning behavior. 
- LiDAR data is used to define the robot's state. After training in simulation, the policy is deployed on a real Husky robot for sim-to-real validation.
- In sim-to-real, we used Unity-ROS system for data communication.
